      <p> I am a software engineering student going into my 3rd year.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia native, interested in coding and have pretty much all the stereotypical nerd hobbies(except watching movies).</p>
      <p>I also have some personal projects on <a href="https://github.com/samejima-san">Github</a> and I will be making more in the future as I have more time.</p>
      <p>The project I am most interested in is my Japanese learning app, which I do want o put on the android store eventually. I had to teach myself Kotlin to make that.</p>
